# 🏙️ All-In-One Urban Mobility Platform

### 🚀 Integrated Smart Transit Planning for Urban Commuters

---

## 🧩 Problem Definition

Urban commuters currently face fragmented mobility experiences.  
Key challenges include scattered data sources, and inefficient route planning via multiple platforms.

**Core Problems**
- Fragmented data across multiple services (public-transportation, personal vehicles).
- Inability to respond to congestion dynamically.
- Lack of centralized safety and congestion insights.

**Impact**
- ⏱️ Inefficient planning and delays.  
- 💸 Increased travel cost.  
- 😣 Poor commuter satisfaction.

**Project Objective**  
To create a **unified mobility platform** integrating all transport modes into a single interface — combining **planning, recommendation, and safety monitoring** for smarter, faster, and safer urban travel.

## Proposed Solution

* **A web platform** separating pre-trip routing from in-trip recommendations, with a safety/alerting layer. 

  * Routing (pre-trip): generates 1–2 itineraries (e.g., *Fastest* and *Normal*) under user constraints.
  * Recommender (in-trip): live ETA/cost options with confidence scores in a kanban-style UI.
  * Safety & alerts: context-aware warnings on congested segments. 
* **In-scope transport modes:** bus, taxi /motorbike, walking. Trains/flights are out-of-scope for MVP. 

---

## Success criteria (PoC)

* **Planning feasibility:** ≥80% of generated itineraries satisfy all hard constraints. 
* **User acceptance of plans:** ≥60% select one of the top-3 plans. 
* **In-trip performance:** on-time ≥80%, missed-connection ≤5%, cost error ≤12%. 
* **Safety value:** alert precision ≥80%, exposure to busy segments ≤15 min/day, CSAT ≥4.2/5.
